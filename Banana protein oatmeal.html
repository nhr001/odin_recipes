    <p>This protein-packed bowl of oatmeal, sweetened with ripe banana and just a touch of maple syrup, uses vanilla 
        protein shake, egg whites to add more protein and make the oats creamy.</p>


    

    <p>Breakfast is one of the most important meals of the day. I try to start every morning with at least 20 grams of 
        protein, especially after a workout which means I am always looking to incorporate more protein into my meals.
         This healthy banana nut oatmeal hits the spot with 20 grams of protein and just 333 calories. Plus, this breakfast
          is super easy and fast to make. For more high-protein breakfasts, try High Protein Oat Waffles, Savory Cottage 
          Cheese Bowl, and High Protein Oat Bread.</p>
