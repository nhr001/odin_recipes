    <p>Incredibly fluffy Low Carb Protein Waffles made with just 4 key ingredients. This simple waffle recipe is 
        healthy, satisfying and easy enough to make everyday for a delicious breakfast! Add your favorite toppings 
        and a drizzle of maple syrup for the perfect morning treat.</p>


    

    <p>These Protein Waffles are my everyday go-to breakfast! I cannot get enough! And if I had to choose between 
        waffles and pancakes… is that even a choice? Waffles are #1 in my book – they require no flipping and then 
        you’ve got those nooks and crannies that perfectly hold sweet drops of maple syrup. There’s just no comparison.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Cooking spray. This is VERY important. Because of the ingredients that make up this protein waffle, you’ll find that it tends to stick to the waffle iron unless you use plenty of cooking spray. I don’t recommend using an all natural olive oil or coconut oil spray, though. To REALLY keep the waffle from sticking your cooking spray should contain soy lecithin. Most contain it and I know it’s not the best, but it works.</li>
        <li>Protein powder. Another important ingredient and it DOES matter what brand of protein powder you use. Many brands I’ve tried, make these waffles dry or too crispy. Tone It Up Protein Powder and PEScience Protein Powder (the snickerdoodle flavor is my favorite) both work well.</li>
        <li>Kodiak Cakes Pancake Mix. For best results, I recommend using half protein powder and half Kodiak Cakes Power Cakes mix. The dark chocolate and almond poppy seed are my favorite flavors.</li>
        <li>Pumpkin puree. This helps give your waffle that fluffy and not too crispy texture. You can also use mashed banana, but I really like pumpkin. It’s lower in calories and carbs and doesn’t have too much taste. I just keep a can in my fridge and measure out what I need each morning.</li>
        <li>Egg whites. For convenience, I recommend pouring from a carton. You could also use egg whites from an actual egg, but it seems a little wasteful for how often I make these.</li>
        <li>Water. I honestly never measure this. I just add water until my batter is at the preferred consistency. It works best if the batter is thick, but pourable (not thin).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <p>Protein waffles are super easy to make with minimal ingredients. I measure all of my ingredients in grams, on a food scale. This isn’t necessary unless you’re counting your macros or simply want your measurements to be exact. Here’s the simple method:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Prep. Heat your waffle iron.</li>
        <li>Mix ingredients. In a medium bowl, stir together protein powder, Kodiak Cakes Mix, egg whites, pumpkin purée (or mashed banana). If needed for consistency, gradually add in a bit of water, 1 tablespoon at a time until the batter can be poured onto the waffle iron, but is still fairly thick.</li>
        <li>Cook. Once your waffle maker is heated, spray it well with the cooking spray. Then, pour batter onto the bottom. Use a spoon to spread the batter over the surface of the waffle iron, and then close it. My waffle iron automatically sounds an alarm when the waffle is finished cooking, after about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve. Remove and enjoy with a drizzle of maple syrup, sliced banana and nut butter or any other favorite toppings.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>STORAGE RECOMMENDATIONS</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Storing leftovers. These will keep in the fridge for up to 4 days or in the freezer for up to 3 months. To keep in the refrigerator, store them in an airtight container. To store in the freezer, wrap them individually in plastic wrap, then place all the wrapped waffles in a large freezer bag.</li>
        <li>Reheating. For best results, reheat in the toaster oven. They will come out crunchy and golden brown. If you’re starting with frozen waffles, you’ll want to add an additional 1-2 minutes to the toasting time.</li>
    </ul>
